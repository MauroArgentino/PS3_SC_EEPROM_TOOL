# PS3_SC_EEPROM_TOOL
Syscon EEPROM Utility for PS3

Based on SPIway by PS3 developer judges <judges@eEcho.com> https://github.com/hjudges/NORway
This tool allows for Read/Write abiltiy on older PS3 Syscon EEPROMs

## Why?
Why not, dont have a bus pirate and wanted wiring simpler without voltage division for 5v logic level on the Arduino based EEPROM tool. Teensy 2.0++ is nicer imo

## TODO:
  - Include a wiring guide.
